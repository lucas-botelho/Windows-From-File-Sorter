# **Media Organizer**

A Windows Forms application built to organize videos and photos stored on a hard drive. This app arranges media files based on their creation dates into a structured folder hierarchy (Year/Month). Designed as a personal project, it aimed to simplify file organization while practicing key development concepts.

## **Features**
- Automatically organizes videos and photos into folders by **Year/Month** based on their creation date.
- Supports bulk processing of files in a specified directory.
- Provides a simple and user-friendly Windows Forms interface.
- Handles common media file types (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.mp4`, `.avi`).

## **Purpose**
- Solve a personal problem of disorganized media files on a hard drive.
- Gain hands-on experience with Windows Forms and practice concepts like:
  - File I/O operations.
  - Working with metadata.
  - Developing a clean and functional desktop application.

## **Technologies Used**
- **C#**: Core programming language for the application logic.
- **.NET Framework**: For building and running the Windows Forms application.
- **Windows Forms**: User interface framework.

## **Future Improvements**
- Implement a preview feature to allow users to verify file organization before committing changes.
- Implement processing in smaller file chunks to handle large directories efficiently without overloading system resources.
- Use multi-threading to process files concurrently, improving performance and reducing processing time for directories with many files.
